 * 
 * Bel changed some characters, making the character disapear in my scene.
 * Added the latest character made by Bel.
 * Found out the 3rd person view camera cannot ratote based on chatacters' rotation
 * So I fixed that problem. Now the 3rd person view camera is 90% done.
 * 
 * 06/12/2019 
 * Add a script thirdPersonCamera attached to Hierarchy/3rdPersonCamera
 * This allows us to have a 3rd person view on a single character and look around
 * by moving the mouse. A certain range has been used to confine the look range.
 * 
 * 06/10/2019
 * I created a folder called ~/Assets/Chujie_Assets and I will work on everything
 * under this folder.
 * 
 * 06/09/2019
 * I downloaded a GhostFreeRoamCamera from Unity Asset Store. This makes the spectator
 * camera move around by pressing WASD (needed to be changed in the future) and 
 * look around on the air.
 * 
 * 06/05/2019
 * I added some trees (from UnityAssetStore/Conifers) and texture (from 
 * UnityAssetStore/ADG_Terxtures) for land for the gamepitch presentation.
