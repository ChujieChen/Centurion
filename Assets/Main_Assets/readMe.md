First attempt to integrate everything is conducted. 
The menu has not been integrated yet. (need more works)
The character control is failed. 
Sunlight needs to be adjusted.
The projectile of the catapult moves with the catapult.
AI is missing.

Character control has been fixed: reimported meleePlayerUpdater and 
genericPlayerMovementController. It turns out that genericPlayerMovementController
cannot be added by the script meleePlayerUpdater.

Another light was added.

Chujie: created this folder for future integration.
Please make the things you want to be integrated as prefabs under your own folder, e.g. Chujie_Assets/Prefabs/Character1.prefab
